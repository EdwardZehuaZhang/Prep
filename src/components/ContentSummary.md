# 1. Big Skeleton of the Course

## 1.1 Four main material families

- **Metals** – strong, stiff, tough, conductive, crystalline.  
- **Polymers** – light, low strength, low thermal/electrical conductivity, good corrosion resistance.  
- **Ceramics & Glass** – strong in compression, hard, brittle, high-temperature, chemically resistant, insulating.  
- **Composites** – combinations (e.g. fibre + matrix) engineered to get “best of both”.

## 1.2 Six property groups (for selection)

- **Physical** – density, melting point, thermal conductivity/expansion, electrical conductivity, optical.  
- **Mechanical** – strength, stiffness (E), hardness, ductility, toughness, fatigue, creep.  
- **Technological** – machinability, castability, forgeability, weldability, formability, etc.  
- **Chemical** – corrosion, oxidation, solvent resistance.  
- **Economic** – cost, availability, processing time.  
- **Aesthetic** – appearance, texture, ability to finish/coat.

## 1.3 Three broad metal forming states

- **Liquid state forming** – casting.  
- **Plastic state forming** – hot deformation (forging, hot rolling, etc.).  
- **Solid state forming** – cold forming of sheet, rod, wire, tube (bending, drawing, stamping, etc.).

## 1.4 Three broad joining options

- **Thermo** (Thermoplastic fusion)  
- **Adhesives**  
- **Mechanical** (assembly/fasteners)

# 2. Engineering Materials – Core Ideas

## 2.1 Metals – structure, strengthening, families

### Crystal structures

- **BCC** – high melting point & strength, low ductility (e.g. W, Mo, some steels).  
- **FCC** – more ductile, good formability (Cu, Al, Ni, Au, Ag, γ-Fe).  
- **HCP** – limited slip systems → lower plasticity, embrittle on cold work (Zn, Mg, Ti).

### Strengthening mechanisms (all about blocking dislocations)

- **Solid solution strengthening** – alloy atoms distort lattice and hinder dislocations.  
- **Work (mechanical) hardening** – plastic deformation multiplies dislocations; they tangle.  
- **Precipitation hardening** – fine particles/precipitates pin dislocations.  
- **Quench hardening** – trapped solute / distorted lattice from rapid cooling raises strength.

### Steel vs cast iron

- **Steels:** ~0.06–2.0% C → workable (rolling, forming, etc.).  
- **Cast irons:** >2% C → too brittle to work; must be cast.

#### Cast irons spectrum (liquid-state-focused)

- **Gray iron** – graphite flakes, good machinability, damping, wear; avoid shock, bending, high stress.  
- **Ductile (nodular) iron** – graphite nodules; higher strength & toughness for shock-loaded parts.  
- **Malleable iron** – good for quantity production, balanced machinability & stability.  
- **White iron** – very hard, abrasion-resistant; wear parts.  
- **Steel castings** – used only when cast irons aren’t strong/tough enough.

### Non-ferrous highlights

- **Aluminum** – high strength/weight, corrosion resistant (oxide film), good formability.  
- **Copper & alloys** – excellent electrical/thermal conductivity; brass (Cu+Zn), bronze (Cu+Sn).  
- **Magnesium** – lightest structural metal, good fatigue & damping, but notch-sensitive.  
- **Zinc** – die-casting alloy; also used to galvanize steel.

## 2.2 Polymers – categories & structures

### By behavior

- **Thermoplastics** – soften on heating, can be remelted.  
- **Thermosets** – cross-linked; set permanently, don’t remelt (they char).  
- **Polymer composites** – polymer matrix + fibre (glass, carbon, aramid, etc.).

### By morphology

- **Amorphous** (PS, PC, ABS, PVC):
  - Broad softening range, transparent possible  
  - Isotropic shrinkage  
  - Good dimensional stability

- **Semi-crystalline** (PE, PP, Nylon, acetal, polyester):
  - Sharp Tm  
  - Stronger/stiffer but less impact-resistant  
  - Anisotropic shrinkage & warpage

- **Liquid crystal polymers (LCPs)** – highly ordered rod-like chains; very low shrinkage/warpage, high mechanical & thermal performance.

### Mixtures & modifiers

- **Copolymers** (two monomers), **terpolymers** (three, e.g. ABS), **blends/alloys** (physical mix of polymers).  
- **Fillers** – glass / mineral / metal powders to improve stiffness, heat resistance, reduce cost.  
- **Plasticizers** – increase flexibility.  
- **Stabilizers, flame retardants, UV additives** – extend durability.

### Continuous vs chopped fibre reinforcement

- **Chopped fibres/particles** → modest improvement, easy processing.  
- **Continuous fibres** → highest stiffness/strength, best creep & fatigue performance.

## 2.3 Ceramics & Glass – essentials

### Ceramics

- **Inorganic, non-metallic**, mostly ionic/covalent bonding.

**Pros**  
- High hardness  
- High temperature capability  
- Chemical & wear resistance  
- Electrically insulating  

**Cons**  
- Brittle  
- Low fracture toughness (but can be improved with fibres/whiskers)

### Main engineering ceramics

- **Metal oxides** – alumina (Al₂O₃), zirconia, beryllia; high-T, often electrical/thermal special roles.  
- **Glass ceramics** – lithium-alumino-silicate, etc.: near-zero thermal expansion, good thermal shock resistance.  
- **Carbides & nitrides** – SiC, Si₃N₄, B₄C, AlN; cutting tools, armor, high-wear parts.

### Glass

- **Amorphous**, hard, brittle, chemically resistant.

- **Soft glass (soda-lime)** – bottles, windows; low Tg, poor thermal shock.  
- **Hard glass (borosilicate / Pyrex)** – labware, ovenware; low expansion, good thermal shock.  
- **Very hard glass (96% silica, fused silica)** – extreme thermal shock resistance, optical & aerospace uses.  
- **Light-sensitive glasses** – photochromic (sunglasses), etc.

# 3. Key Mechanical Properties (must know vocabulary)

- **Stress (σ)** = load / area.  
- **Strain (ε)** = deformation / original length.  
- **Elastic region** – linear σ–ε; returns when load removed; slope = **E** (modulus of elasticity) = stiffness.  
- **Yield strength / proof stress** – stress where permanent deformation starts.  
- **UTS** – maximum stress before necking / fracture.  
- **Ductility** – ability to plastically deform in tension (elongation, reduction of area).  
- **Malleability** – plastic deformation in compression (forging, rolling).  
- **Toughness** – energy absorbed to fracture (Charpy / Izod).  
- **Hardness** – resistance to indentation/scratch (Brinell, Vickers, Rockwell).  
- **Brittleness** – fractures with little/no plastic deformation.  
- **Fatigue** – failure under repeated/cyclic loading at stresses < static strength.  
- **Creep** – time-dependent deformation under constant load, usually at elevated T.

# 4. Metal Forming – Liquid, Plastic, Solid

## 4.1 Liquid State Forming – Casting

### Why casting?

- Economical for complex shapes, putting metal only where needed.  
- Good for large parts, complex internal passages (cores).

### Key processes

- **Sand casting** – patterns, cope/drag, core, core print, riser, gating; large tolerance & rough surface.  
- **Investment (lost wax)** – wax pattern → ceramic/plaster shell → high accuracy, thin sections; low size limits.  
- **Shell molding** – resin-bonded sand shell, better surface & accuracy than sand.  
- **Permanent mold / gravity die casting** – reusable metal molds; non-ferrous (Al, Zn, etc.), good surface.  
- **Die casting (hot & cold chamber)** – high-pressure injection into metal dies, very good tolerances & surface, but limited to non-ferrous and relatively small parts.  
- **Centrifugal casting** – hollow symmetry parts (pipes, rings) by spinning mold.

### Defects & design

- Solidification → dendrites, grains, porosity; shrinkage must be fed with risers.  
- Fine equiaxed grains > coarse columnar grains (unless directional properties are desired).

### Process comparison criteria

- Tolerance  
- Surface finish  
- Maximum size  
- Castable alloys  
- Tooling/part cost  
- Availability

## 4.2 Plastic State Forming – Forging, Rolling, Extrusion, Drawing

**Plastic state forming** = hot working at elevated T but below melting.

Main value: **grain flow follows shape** → better fatigue, impact, and overall strength than cast/machined.

### Forging

- **Hammer/Drop forging** – impact blows.  
- **Press forging** – slower, continuous pressure.  
- **Upset / heading** – increases diameter by compressing length (bolts, screws, valves).  
- **Swaging** – reduces diameter by radial hammering.

### Rolling

- **Hot rolling** – reduction above recrystallization temperature ⇒ coarse surface but cheap.  
- **Cold rolling** – further reduction at lower T → smoother surface, higher strength, tighter tolerances (cost + ~20%).

### Drawing & extrusion

- **Wire/rod drawing** – pull through dies to smaller diameters.  
- **Extrusion** – push heated billet through die; can produce complex profiles (solid, semi-hollow, hollow).

## 4.3 Solid State Forming – Sheet, Wire, Tube Forming

### Simple bending

- Bending sheet adds stiffness and strength; very common for enclosures, appliances, furniture.  
- Tools: press brake (air bending & V-die), wiping die, roll bending.

### Continuous roll forming

- Long sheet passes through multiple roller stations → constant cross-section shapes (similar to metal extrusions but limited to sheet thickness).

### Wire & tube bending

- **Wire bending** → cheap & strong; used in wire chairs, racks, fixtures.  
- **Tube bending** requires mandrel support to prevent buckling; iconic in tubular furniture (e.g. Wassily chair).

### Spinning

- Rotate a disk of sheet on a lathe and form over a mandrel; produces symmetric “cup”/dish shapes; good for low-volume, cheap tooling.

### Deep drawing & hydroforming

- **Drawing** – punch pulls sheet into die cavity to form hollow shapes (cups, cans).  
- **Deep drawing** – depth ≥ 2× diameter; often multiple stages.  
- **Hydroforming** – press sheet with fluid + flexible membrane; good for complex deep parts and bike frames.

# 5. Metal Cutting – Sheet, Chip, Non-chip, Thermal

## 5.1 Sheet cutting (shearing & punching)

- **Punching** – remove internal scrap (holes).  
- **Blanking** – the punched-out piece is the product.  
- **CNC turret press** – fast, automatic tool changes.  
- **Shearing** – scissor-like cutting; clearance “c” critical for quality (too large → distortion, big burr).  
- **Deburring** – removing sharp burrs (vibratory bowls, etc.).

## 5.2 Chip-forming machining

**Machining** = chip-forming cutting with tolerances ≈ ±0.1 mm (or much finer with CNC).

Common operations:

- **Sawing** – rough length cutting.  
- **Drilling & reaming** – holes then precision sizing.  
- **Turning (lathe)** – rotating workpiece, stationary tool.  
- **Milling** – rotating cutter, moving workpiece.  
- **Boring** – enlarging/finishing internal diameters.  
- **Grinding** – abrasive wheel for very fine finish & tight tolerances (±0.005 mm).  
- **Broaching** – multi-tooth tool; one pass, very accurate profiles.  
- **Machining centers & turning centers** – CNC, multiple tools, automate almost all operations.

## 5.3 Non-chip (advanced) processes

- **Chemical machining (CM)** – mask + etchant; shallow cavities, low tooling cost.  
- **Electrochemical machining (ECM)** – reverse of electroplating, deep complex cavities in conductive materials.  
- **Electrical discharge machining (EDM)** – spark erosion in conductive materials; precise, no cutting forces; includes wire EDM.  
- **Abrasive jet machining (AJM)** – high-speed abrasive jet; any material, minimal heat.  
- **Waterjet / hydrodynamic machining (HDM)** – high-velocity water (often with abrasive), near-no heat, clean cuts, little finishing.

## 5.4 Flame / thermal cutting

- **Oxy-acetylene cutting** – steel plates, portable, thick sections.  
- **Plasma-arc cutting (PAC)** – hotter than oxy-fuel, smoother cuts, works on stainless & non-ferrous, easy to automate.  
- **Laser & electron-beam machining** – very fine, precise, high-energy beams.

# 6. Polymers – Fabrication Processes

## 6.1 Thermoplastic processes

### Injection molding

- Pellets → melted in barrel → injected into cooled mold (clamp, inject, dwell, cool, open, eject).  
- High production rate, high repeatability, complex shapes; high tooling & machine cost.  
- Variants:
  - **Bi-injection** (two colours/materials)  
  - **Co-injection** (skin/core for cost or performance)

### Blow molding

- **Extrusion blow** – parison + mold + air → hollow bodies (bottles).  
- **Stretch blow** – biaxial stretching (better properties, visual quality).

### Calendering & film processes

- **Calendering** – force plastic through heated rolls to sheets/films.  
- **Film**: slit-die extrusion, calendering, tubular (blown film).

### Extrusion

- Continuous shapes (profiles, pipes, sheets, filaments).  
- Simple die, constant cross-section.

### Rotational molding

- Powder in hollow mold → heated & rotated → melts and coats wall → cooled → large hollow parts (tanks, kayaks).  
- Low tooling cost; long cycle time.

### Thermoforming (vacuum forming)

- Heat sheet below melt → drape over/into mold → vacuum pulls sheet to shape → trim.  
- Great for medium runs, prototyping, large thin shells.

### Solid-phase forming

- Forming above Tg but below Tm to refine properties without melting.

## 6.2 Thermoset & composite processes

### Basic thermoset behavior

- Supplied as liquid or solid; cure via cross-linking (heat, catalyst, etc.).  
- Once cured, no remelting.

### Key thermoset processes

- **Compression molding** – charge in open mold → close & heat → cure under pressure.  
- **Transfer molding** – material preheated in pot → pushed into cavities.  
- **Thermoset injection molding** – inject low-viscosity thermoset, cure in mold, eject, then often post-cure.  
- **Foam molding** – reactive mixture + blowing → cellular core with denser skins (seats, furniture).  
- **Reaction injection molding (RIM)** – low-viscosity reactants mix & react in mold (e.g. polyurethane auto parts).  
- **Casting & rotational casting** – pour reactive resin into mold (sometimes rotated) → cure.  
- **Sintering** – high-T polymers formed by bonding compressed powders.  
- **Vulcanization** – rubber cross-linking (sulfur, heat) → stable, non-sticky, durable elastomer.

### Polymer composite processes (big picture)

- **Matrices:** phenolics, epoxies, unsaturated polyesters (most common), some thermoplastics.  
- **Reinforcements:** glass, carbon, aramid; continuous vs chopped.  
- **Processes:** hand lay-up, spray-up, resin transfer molding (RTM), pultrusion, filament winding, etc.  
  - Core idea: place fibres where loads are.

# 7. Ceramics & Glass – Forming & Firing

## Ceramic forming routes

### Liquid state (casting)

- **Slip casting** into porous moulds (e.g. sanitary ware).

### Plastic state forming

- **Extrusion**, **injection molding**, **jiggering**; clay is plastic when wet.

### Pressing (solid state)

- Dry or wet pressing powders in dies; **hot pressing** for dense parts.

### After forming

- **Drying** – remove water; watch for warping/cracking.  
- **Firing / sintering** – high-T treatment; densifies, strengthens, reduces porosity. Shrinkage up to ~20%.  
- **Finishing** – grinding, lapping, sometimes EDM/USM.  
- **Glazing** – final impervious glassy skin, improves look and strength.

## Glass forming

- **Float process** – molten glass floats on molten tin → flat glass with good finish.  
- **Rolling** – sheet glass via rollers (needs grinding/polishing unless textured).  
- **Drawing** – rods/tubes drawn from melt with mandrel & rollers.  
- **Fibre drawing** – fine fibres for insulation & optical fibres.  
- **Blowing** – bottles, bulbs; blown parison into mould by air.  
- **Pressing** – gob pressed into mould (tableware, lenses).  
- **Centrifugal casting/spinning** – symmetric shapes (TV tubes, aerospace domes).  
- **Sagging** – heated sheet sags into shallow moulds (diffusers, lenses).

### Strengthening glass

- **Thermal tempering** – quench surfaces; residual compressive stresses; breaks into small cubes.  
- **Chemical tempering** – ion exchange; deeper compressive layer, better scratch resistance.  
- **Laminating** – glass + plastic interlayer (windscreens); holds fragments together.

# 8. Joining – Thermoplastic Fusion, Adhesives, Mechanical

## 8.1 Thermoplastic fusion methods

- **Ultrasonic welding** – high-frequency vibrations (10–75 kHz) produce local heating at joint; very fast, strong joints; needs good joint design, horn & fixtures.  
- **Vibration welding** – rubbing two parts under pressure until interface melts; good for large parts & hermetic seals; limited to single plane joints.  
- **Spin welding** – rotate one part against another; frictional heating at circular interface; tongues/grooves & flash traps improve strength/appearance.  
- **Electromagnetic welding (induction bonding)** – magnetic field heats ferromagnetic particle-filled gasket; gasket melts and bonds parts.  
- **Hot plate welding** – heat both surfaces on a platen, then press together; simple, but creates beads (must hide or trim).  
- **Staking** – deform thermoplastic stud to lock components; can be done by heat or ultrasonics.

## 8.2 Adhesive bonding

### Why use adhesives?

- Smooth, invisible joints  
- Join thin/fragile or dissimilar materials  
- Distribute stress uniformly  
- Provide sealing & damping

### Limitations

- Shelf life  
- Many formulations  
- Surface prep & curing control needed  
- Often destructive testing only  
- Cleaning required

### Loads they like

- **Shear, compression, tension**  
- Avoid **peel** – design joints to minimize peeling forces.

### Adhesive families

- **Epoxies** – versatile, strong, good temperature & chemical resistance, 1- or 2-part systems.  
- **Urethanes** – strong + flexible, good for impact and dynamic joints.  
- **Anaerobics** – cure in absence of oxygen (e.g. threadlockers).  
- **Cyanoacrylates** – “super glues”; very fast setting with surface moisture, limited temperature and gap.  
- **Acrylics** – strong, often no primer, fast room-temperature cure.

### Surface prep methods

- Cleaning & degreasing  
- Abrasion  
- Flame treatment  
- Corona discharge  
- Plasma  
- Chemical etch  

### Solvent bonding

- For amorphous thermoplastics (e.g. ABS, acrylic): solvent partially dissolves surfaces → polymer chains interdiffuse → pure material-to-material bond after evaporation.

## 8.3 Mechanical assembly & fasteners

### Thermoplastic mechanical options

- **Press-fits** – interference fits; no hermetic seal, must consider creep & thermal expansion.  
- **Inserts** – metal inserts added by press-fit, expansion, ultrasonic, thermal, or molding-in; used for repeated assembly and higher thread strength.  
- **Snap-fits** – molded flexible features that “snap” into place; designed for permanent or multiple use.  
- **Molded-in plastic threads** – for simple threaded joints in plastic.

### Fasteners

- **Self-tapping screws** –  
  - Thread-forming (TF) vs thread-cutting (TC)  
  - TF induces residual stresses  
  - TC can damage threads on repeated use  

- **Clamped fastener design** – compressive stress in plastic; consider stress relaxation (especially at high T); washers & large heads help distribute load.  

- **Rivets** – permanent joints; need large heads/washers to avoid stress concentrations; Al rivets often preferred over steel.

### DFMA angle

- Mechanical fasteners themselves are cheap, but assembly time is expensive.  
- Minimize part count, standardize fastener types and sizes, consider automatic assembly.
